# houses_prices
predicting houses prices by using RandomForestRegressor Model
- using Python in jupyter notebook
- Finished project and it's a kaggle compition- finished but we can alwys improve our Model
- from the begining I choosed the Feautres(columns) that I want to work with and use them in my Model
- my choosen Feautres(columns) depends on how many missing values that they have because when a column have more than 70 % of missing values I excluded and
- I filled some missing values for other important columns with the  values that suited best
